Who is the House of
Hertfordshire?
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After Churchill's second disastrous beach invasion
the
Briton population became disenchanted with the Prime Minister.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Relations with the United Governments broke
down when loyalists saw their sovereignty under threat by the
institution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With a spread out military,
crumbling
empire, and no economic recovery in sight, the time was ripe for
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many powerful families
attempted to pull coups on the government with their own military
contingents,
but the one from the county of Hertfordshire ultimately won out.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It's agenda was and is to this day to
restore legitimate power and authority to the crown, and regain the
Empire
which was lost through the wars, Commons' corruption, and transition
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The House of Hertfordshire has
worked hard to portray itself as the true noble ruling family, but
insiders
know that the lineage is anything but pure and that anyone with the
means and
influence could take over the crown and the name of Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why the hell are
they involved?</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the years of turmoil, Great Britain lost nearly
all of
her colonies, many to Unigov.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The House
of Hertfordshire is now in a bind for resources. Instead of entering
into
unfavorable trade agreements with lesser countries the House wants to
instead
reestablish the lost empire by reconquering lost territory and prove to
the
people and the rest of the world the crown's legitimacy.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">The look:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of the various Risen factions, Hertfordshire is
decidedly
the most retro looking. Perhaps it is because of the ruling house's
efforts to
bring everyone into the old school imperial mentality that soldier's
uniforms
resemble a mixture of WWI era and Colonial Era.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Infantry
uniforms are colored tan with white trim. The vehicles
follow a similar design, though they are ivory with decorated with
ornate
gilded ironworks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Buildings are in the
Victorian style.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The theme of Hert
gameplay:</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you set out to reconquer the world from one
little
island, mobility is the key.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Hert
don&#8217;t have a high starting population cap, so they must build
Garrison Posts in
order to recruit more infantry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
helps make them an anti-turtling faction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But not only is speed key to their maneuverability, they can
also gain
the ability to drop behind enemy lines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And with the addition of hover vehicles and a strong air force,
not even
water or mountains are safe barriers fro the enemy any more.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the old-fashioned looks,
Hertfordshire weaponry is actually powerful, long ranged, and often
line-of-sight, though not terribly rapid.<br>
<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">Buildings and Tech:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> Building materials for the House of
Hertfordshire are paradropped in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Hert command center is the Field HQ.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Military Academy trains the infantry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Garrison
Posts on strategic points can be used to increase the
pop cap and train troops as well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stirling Generators provide the power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Research is done at the Royal Archives, while vehicles are built
at the
Auto Garage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hertfordshire uses a lot
of artillery for defense, starting with the anti-infantry Pounder,
which can be
upgraded to the anti-tank Longbow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Rapier Anti-Air System can be built standalone instead of being an
upgrade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Aerobase will allow you to
paradrop troops, vehicles, and artillery behind enemy lines.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Hertford House will let you pick one of
the family members vying for the crown. Depending on the hero you
summon, your
entire army will gain benefits that reflect that ruler.<br>

 style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; </span><br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span>The
labourer is your basic builder unit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Commando is the starting infantry unit. He is useful for
scouting
and can be upgraded for demolitions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Fusilier with his semi-auto rifle is a happy medium between
assault
infantry and a sniper and is expectedly weak in close range combat.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Vickers gunner takes awhile to set up
but biomechanical upgrades will enable him to shoot from the hip.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Anti-Tank Rifleman can shoot his quick
depleted uranium round past anti-missile defenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Jet Jumper is Risen&#8217;s only flying infantry and he
strikes a
deadly blow with his &#8220;light sabre&#8221; (which is just a
fluorescent tube filled
with flammable liquid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Black Watch
is a high-tier squad that can take any terrain with no speed loss and
can take
up the close-medium range gap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Major is the Hert squad leader.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Knight wears experimental power armour and can be fitted with a number
of
deadly weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Royal Heroes
include Edmund with his power abilities, Algernon with speed, and Becki
with
health.<br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Vehicles:</span><span style=""><br>
<br>
</span>Hertfordshire mixes up the vehicle tech tree a bit by starting
out with
an artillery unit with the small Motorized Battery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Armoured Trolley takes out enemy infantry while carrying
it&#8217;s
own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Conqueror II Hovertanks glide
over terrain that halts other tanks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Hussar Skirmishing Vehicle is short range but can quickly
encircle
enemy ranks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Lancer Laser Tank is
slow but can use its varying intensity laser beam to destroy both
planes and
buildings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the sky we have the
Wyvern Hover Jet that has the speed of a plane and the maneuverability
of a
rotorcraft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Pegasus can transport
both infantry and vehicles.</span><span

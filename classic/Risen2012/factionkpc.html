<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who is the KPC? </span><br>
<br>
Two of the largest and most imposing armies
in modern history are now one in the world of Risen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without an immediate threat from Germany, Russia went eastward
to
deal with old rival Japan and subsequently help Mao overthrow the
Chinese
Nationalist Party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What resulted was
the Sino-Russian Alliance, or in Cyrillic, KPC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basically
the good ol&rsquo; communist side you expect to find in most
RTS&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why the hell are
they involved? </span><br>
</p>
The collectivization of 75%
of the Asian landmass was sure enough to get Unigov&rsquo;s attention.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Even so, Unigov feared getting involved in
direct military conflict with the KPC. But behind the iron shroud of
military
expenditure, lay an impoverished populace and political corruption.
Unigov
decided it could break down the KPC into manageable chunks by
exploiting this.
It sent in incendiary task forces to incite division and rebellion. Now
the KPC
has had it up to here and has decided to respond with it&rsquo;s own
remaining
strength.<br>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The look: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The KPC army units will probably be the most
recognizable of the bunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything
from the 40&rsquo;s to the 70&rsquo;s is thrown in there. Infantry
dress in long overcoats
with less visible body armor than the other armies. Vehicles are large,
low
profile, with big guns, and rather utilitarian exterior (ya know, all
the
techno junk like reactive armor and the like, makes for a less than
smooth
exterior).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Buildings largely have a
bunkered look about them, with a mixture of onion domes and terra cotta
roofs
as flair.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The theme of KPC
gameplay: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Numbers and firepower are what
it&rsquo;s all about for the KPC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
standard infantryman has little training and is poorly equipped, but
they are
expendable when you are overpopulated by about a billion. This means
that KPC
has a much higher pop cap and quicker and cheaper unit production than
the
other guys, but with the average soldier being not as capable.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>To further emphasize the mass and throw
philosophy, no units have healing or repair capabilities, except for
workers on
buildings; and squads require less micromanagement to get the most out
of them.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buildings and
Tech: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Due to the vast and harsh KPC territory,
buildings are transported in by helicopter They are comparatively
sturdy but
can be ever more protected by adding defensive guns on them.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Party Headquarters goes through two
additional tiers that can be added in any order, though you will have
to
satisfy additional requirements no matter what the second add-on is. In
addition to your starting units, the Onion Dome Add-on will give you
access to
more Russianesque units, like the Minigunner and Pavlichenko Sniper
Squad, and
more fire rate researches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Terra
Cotta Roof Add-on gives you more Chinese units, like the Shuriken
Driver and
the Cycling Soviets, and more flame researches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Red Square is the main research building. In addition to the
aforementioned you can also develop your propaganda machine (reduces
enemy
morale while bolstering your own).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defenses include a Minigun Turret and SAM Site. The Nuclear
Plant lets
you develop nuclear-powered vehicles and weapons, however accidents
have been
known to occur&hellip;<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Infantry: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Conscript will be your basic unit for awhile,
they are cheap and plentiful, but start out with only half morale, so
bolster
every squad with a Commissar to keep them from running away.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Assign a member to be a standard bearer to
increase the resolve and firepower of the rest of the squad.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Red Guard is pretty much upgraded
versions of the conscripts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
advanced units brought by the HQ add-ons are more specialized in their
role.
The Russian upgrade brings in Minigunners and Pavlichenko Snipers.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chinese upgrade brings the anti-tank
Fire Lancer, and the Shuriken Driver, which is a higher mobility
anti-infantry.
Each side also has some sort of General for the hero unit.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Vehicles: </span><br>
<br>
I haven&rsquo;t really assigned all the vehicles
to a certain tier yet so I&rsquo;ll just list some of them. The Cycling
Soviets are
fast but very weak so they are best used as spying units.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The BMP is the main transport. It&rsquo;s mainly
anti-infantry but can be upgraded to fire AV shells or missiles.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The T-105 Twin Eagle is the MBT. It has two
barrels (for twice the fun) and can be upgraded to run people over.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chain Tank is used mainly against
aircraft or heavy infantry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Katyusha Rocket Artillery has an ability to shoot all of its rockets in
one
volley, though it&rsquo;s more inaccurate than regular fire.<span
 style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Hurricane is a large helicopter with the
dual-role of assault and transport.</span><span

Who are the neoVisigoths? </span><br>
<br>
Even having brokered a ceasefire
with the Germans, the other nations knew they couldn&#8217;t be trusted
not to strike
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They aimed to keep Germany&#8217;s
military capability in check through tactics such as sanctions,
blockades,
attrition, and bombing runs targeting infrastructure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This worked so well that civil order broke down, and disease,
starvation, and pestilence broke out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even though German territory has slunk back into the Dark Age,
the
thirst for revenge is a powerful driver for one of the Germanic clans.<br>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why the hell are
they involved? </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rather than risking direct
military action against Hertfordshire and the KPC, Unigov decided
instead to
fund and provide arms to the upstart neoVisigoths.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even barbarians can be useful if they can cause trouble for your
greater enemies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the plan soon
backfired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before Unigov could secure
it&#8217;s foothold in Europe the neoVisigoths realized they were being
used as meat
shields and revolted. In classic gothic horror novel sense, the
doctor&#8217;s
monstrous creation has now turned against him.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The look: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How would you expect a neoVisigoth to look?
Exactly. Take some tattered nazi uniform; add some leather, and a
little animal
hide to top it off. Also the pale skinniness is due to disease and
malnutrition
more than fashion sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Buildings are
mostly ruined civilian ones with vaulted arches and roofs and the like.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Vehicles are mostly converted WWII tanks, so
they have that familiar blocky shape but are now adorned with spikes
and crude
modifications (cause spikes are cool).<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The theme of
neoVisigothic gameplay:&nbsp; </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The neoVisigoths are the first of the
nonprofessional armies we&#8217;ll talk about. Lacking brute military
power, they are
forced, you could say, to use unconventional warfare, largely directed
at an
enemy&#8217;s infrastructure and starving them out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The way this translates to DOW is that when certain units attack
the enemy&#8217;s
buildings, they effects can include leeching req. and power, slowing or
pausing
production queues, or making the enemy produce units at reduced health.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When they do get into direct combat, the
poorly trained neoVisigoths suffer from bad accuracy. To make up for
this they
utilize some powerful and draining Area of Effect weapons.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buildings and
Tech: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Instead of having their buildings
transported in, the neoVisigoths dig up their buildings on the spot
(yes it
isn&#8217;t fluffy but that&#8217;s minor). They start out with a
Cathedral with can have
fortifications added on. From there your basic infantry come from the
good ol&#8217;
Tavern. Researches for weapons and things such as Chemical Warfare,
Scorched
Earth, and Smog of War are done at the Institution. The Motorwerks
let&#8217;s you
salvage enemy vehicles for reduced production time on your own vehicles.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>At the top (or near the top, who knows right
now) is the Wewelsburg Castle which let&#8217;s you do research into
the occult and
produce units of the like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There might
be a Rocket Facility in there too somewhere. Defenses include a MG Nest
or
Artillery Tower that upgrades to Flak.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Infantry: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Though not terribly strong in reality, the sight
of gothic infantry still does good to scare the wits out of the enemy.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Mechaniker builds buildings and repairs
stuff like most do, but he can also salvage parts from ruined vehicles
from the
enemy or your own. The Goths aren&#8217;t particularly loyal to any
Germanic clan but
you can use them to distract the enemy or easy captures. They carry
Spyder
machine pistols that are dually used as small axes. The Gothic Trooper
has some
rifle that also doubles as an axe. Being flexible, you can upgrade the
Gothic
Trooper to more specialized roles or later on build specialized squads
such as
the Flametrooper (self-explanatory), the Flaktrooper (anti-vehicle) or
the
Chemicaltrooper (for that long lasting flavor).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Leutnant leads most squads and uses smoke grenades.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Occultist makes fear-inducing chants and
heals friendlies. The coveted UberSoldat is uber strong and has weapons
like
the rocklet rifle. Heroes include Lilith Victoria and Wilhelm
Ravenhurst who
have various pandemic creating abilities.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vehicles: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Vehicles are not easy to come by for the
neoVisigoths, but the process becomes more painless if you use the
Mechaniker&#8217;s
salvage ability effectively. Because they are custom-built, the
vehicles can
take a large variety of add-ons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
squad pushes around the Scythe Infantry Gun but it counts as a vehicle.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It starts out with a Machine Gun but can be
upgraded to Flak, Mortar, or AV shells.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Slayer Panzer starts with a Flak Turret, but a Mortar Tube
or Rocket
Rack can be added on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Impaler is a
tank chassis with a much-too-oversized artillery piece mounted on it.
If you
can protect it long enough to reach the enemy&#8217;s buildings, the
trouble will be
well worth it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Pestilence is a
Wespe modified into a catapult for indirect fire. It launches dead
corpses into
the enemy position to disease and weakens them for when your main force
arrives. The Zeppelin is slow but has the advantage of dropping troops
behind
enemy lines without having to land first.</p>

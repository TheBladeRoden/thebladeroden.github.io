Who is Unigov?</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After the great tolls of depression and the
European war,
the western allies formed the United Governments, a multinational
organization
designed to aid in their common economic recovery and political
stability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Great Britain dropped out
due to a royal
coup, Unigov used this event to justify centralizing administrative
power to
prevent political corruption in its member nations. Well, publicly
anyway.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why the hell are
they involved?</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Unigov spent most of its day protecting those on
the inside
from &#8220;barbaric&#8221; peoples on the outside. But as the world
grew smaller, the
dangers became more imminent. Rather than simply destroying these
states,
Unigov instead decided that the humanitarian thing to do was to bring
international law to these people and ultimately unite the world under
one
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As you can imagine, not
everyone is willing to go along with this plan peaceably, so Unigov has
backed
up its ambassadors with some armed battalions to provide a little
incentive.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">The look:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For many years, the individual national armies or
foreign
mercenary groups handled offshore military actions, while Unigov
provided
internal security detail, particularly in large urban areas.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Thusly the Union Army resembles a large
special
police force than a traditional military.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soldiers dress in navy uniforms (though the higher ups have more
gold
trim) and wear external body armor and joint pads. They also have
distinctive
chrome helmets and riot shields.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
the prevalent justice system, Unigov buildings are built in a
Romanesque style,
with X&#8217;d window frames and references to its circular symbol
repeated in
archways and domes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weapons and
vehicles have a compact and sophisticated look for use in urban
operations,
also having a bluish gray tone and arched roofs.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The theme of
Union gameplay:</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Having been a security force for many years, the
Union Army
is all about preservation and protection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But that doesn&#8217;t mean Unigov units all have the thickest
armor, instead
they are more dependent on support units to stay in the fight.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Because it is too costly to just throw your
units away and buy new ones, the Union Army relies instead on engineers
to
swiftly repair buildings and vehicles, self-healing nanotechnology, and
reactive armor to make sure they get their penny&#8217;s worth. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>Soldiers too, are professional, organized,
but also trained to be self-reliant. Therefore, they are less likely to
break
at the first sign of trouble or when a squad leader gets killed. But
the more
they are bogged down; the moral drain will gradually effect a larger
portion of
the army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being largely a peacekeeping
force, Unigov uses many less-than-lethal weapons, but these are useful
in
keeping the enemy stunned when your lethal units move in.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buildings and
Tech:</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Unigov Mission Control is brought in by a
dropship,
while the other buildings have their parts shipped in by supply truck.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Dispatch Station and the Deployment
Hangar build infantry and vehicles respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Security Center is where the weapon research is done, expand
LOS, and later where you&#8217;ll be able to build SEOS teams.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Courthouse can build the under
appreciated hero units, Security Guard and Lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Surveillance post can be upgraded to build Spy Drones and
Combat Engineers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A slag deposit must
be found to build a Particle Constructer and research nanotechnology.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Infantry:</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Though now involved in offensive operations, the
Union Army
has retained much of the organization, weapons, and uniforms it used
back when
it was just a fledgling security force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You start out with the Combat Engineer and the Military Police.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>They are both armed with pistols but the
Military Police can be upgraded with shock sticks and sonic concussion
guns,
and can carry bullet resistant poly shields at the cost of foot speed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The basic fighting unit is the Union Assault
Team. They wear more body armor than the Military Police and can too
carry poly
shields, but theirs can be upgraded to be blast resistant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They start with bullpup assault rifles,
which can be replaced with shotguns, grenade launchers, the Mower LMG,
and the
Javelin AT system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>K-9 units are made
for speed and to break enemy morale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Squad Captains can auto-heal their teams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
SEOS are Unigov&#8217;s stealthy special forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
use SMG&#8217;s, Flashbangs, and the
Sharpmaster Rifle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Demolitions
Squad is heavily armored and led by a Bomb Robot. Their presence
lessens the
effects of explosions on nearby units.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Heroes include the Century Commander, Security Director
Lentulus, and
the unstoppable duo of Security Guard and Lawyer.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Vehicles:</span><span style=""><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
</span></span>Unigov&#8217;s vehicle selection is flexible and well
rounded overall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are best used for
medium-long range
targets can be fitted with close range countermeasures.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Enforcer is the standard pursuit SUV. It
comes with a mounted machine gun and can be equipped with an EMP
missile
launcher to stop fleeing (or pursuing) vehicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Rammer LAV can be adapted for many roles. It carries soldiers
and is armed with a large caliber machine gun. A hydraulic ram or
grenade
launchers can also be added on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Gladius is Unigov&#8217;s Main Battle Tank. It&#8217;s the best going
one on one against
other tanks with high-powered rounds and anti-missile sonic shockwave
generators but it is mighty pricey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Mobile Command Center is a support vehicle that can spawn engineers,
increase
LOS, and detect stealth units.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Streetcrawler is an artillery unit that launches long range missiles
against
both air and ground targets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Peacekeeper Gunship is a swift helicopter that can sneak in to disrupt
enemy
lines before the main force arrives. </span>

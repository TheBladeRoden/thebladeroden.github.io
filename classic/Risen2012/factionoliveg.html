Who is Olive
Green? </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Olive Green was once a peaceful
organization of environmental activists, but suppression by the growing
Unigov
drove it underground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When passive
demonstration alone couldn&#8217;t get the message out, a fringe sect
of Olive Green
took action by way of ecoterrorism to disrupt the sprawl of resource
hungry
corporations and cities and promote their cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
effectiveness of violent sabotage and a baleful, fatidic view
of human society have slowly transformed Olive Green into militant cult.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why the hell are
they involved? </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By the turn of the
millennium, J.P. Montegomery foresaw overpopulation, desperation for
resources,
and the regained military egos of the major nations leading to a major
war that
could destroy the natural Earth more than any logging company.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He then established the Final Peace
initiative, which imbued Olive Green toward the goal of collapsing
man&#8217;s
civilization before civilization destroyed itself and the Earth along
with it.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The look: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It&#8217;s interesting how serious I am in the
faction
summaries then get really silly starting at &#8220;the look&#8221;
section. And on that
note, Olive Green is not bound to the whole tie-dyed and poncho look,
this is
2012! They have a combined look of hikers, campers, and guerillas, so
the drab
green hiking vests and khaki pants really fit them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Higher-ranking members will wear more militaristic trench coats
and berets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A common tying bond is a red
scarf, or kerchief in some cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Buildings and vehicles will have a similar worn look, and are
covered in
moss, and other overgrowth.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The theme of
Green gameplay: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Being part of no formal
military, Olive Green members are usually indistinguishable from other
civilians. Plus, the loose organizational structure of Olive Green
makes them
difficult to track.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These qualities are
translated to the game by making stealth their main strength.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Most units are capable of stealth while
their armies only have one or two units of the type.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because of the damage scale in R2K12SOW, their ambush
capabilities are even more lethal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
do need this stealth ability because units are generally short-ranged
and some
require being right next to an enemy to do their work.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buildings and
Tech: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not being too keen on constructing their
own buildings, Olive Green prefers to outfit abandoned civilian ones to
suit
their needs (but I guess in the game I&#8217;ll have to make them
magically appear
out of the dust or something). Anyway, I haven&#8217;t gotten to deep
into developing
their building setup but the Action Center will be the main HQ while
the
Initiation Hostel recruits infantry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fluid structure of Olive Green also let&#8217;s you teleport
buildings to
other locations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also Olive Green&#8217;s
resource system is different than the other factions&#8217;. Because
even Olive Green
members have their own drain on nature like other humans, each member
will
drain a small amount of req. and power while they are still alive. If
these
resources run out, units will start killing themselves until a positive
flow is
restored. So watch it! You can also building instant heavy cover
anywhere.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Infantry: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Activist is the basic assault unit and is was
converted enemy units default to, until you make the researches to
upgrade him
to Free Radical and Eco-Warrior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Protester Crowd is practically useless to attack with but their large
numbers
can tie up an advancing army while your stealth units go to work. They
also
cause confusion because they are visually identical to the Armed Riot
Crowd,
which is a lot more dangerous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Heavy Spiker drives railroad spikes not just into trees anymore.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The Infiltrator is a non-offensive spy that
defaults to invisibility. The Recruiter converts enemy units to
Activists (or
whatever) to fight for you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
the Saboteur captures enemy vehicles (though they don&#8217;t come
pristine). The
Monkeywrencher firebombs enemy buildings. The Herbalist is the healer
unit.
J.P. Montegomery is the only hero.<br>
<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vehicles: </span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since vehicles go against everything Olive Green
stand for, they don&#8217;t make many.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Minibus is the exception for some reason; it&#8217;s their favorite
means of
transportation. The Looted Bulldozer was once used to clear natural
land for
urban construction. Now it has turned against it&#8217;s master and is
now used to
tear down his buildings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you can
find any vehicles to capture you can always go to the speedy but greeny
Safari
Dune Buggy.</p>
